*** THIS IS INCOMPLETE! ***



These two shell scripts will greatly automate the process of setting up a master/Slave MySQL replicated pair.

FILES:

master.sh - should be executed on the master server.
July 30, 2013 - This is working fully for replication on individual databases, still incomplete for all db replication.



slave.sh - should be executed on the slave server.



These scripts must be executed by the root user (in order to write to mysql config files)
