These two shell scripts will greatly automate the process of setting up a master/Slave MySQL replicated pair.

FILES:

master.sh - should be executed on the master server.
-- July 30, 2013 : This script should be fully functional at this time.


slave.sh - should be executed on the slave server.
-- NOT YET CREATED.


These scripts must be executed by the root user (in order to write to mysql config files)
