These two shell scripts will greatly automate the process of setting up a master/Slave MySQL replicated pair.

FILES:

master.sh - should be executed on the master server.
-- July 30, 2013 : This script should be fully functional at this time.
-- August 2, 2013 : Added bind-address = 0.0.0.0 so remote connections work.


slave.sh - should be executed on the slave server.
-- August 1, 2013 : Initial version, very alpha..


These scripts must be executed by the root user (in order to write to mysql config files)
